	abstract  = {In this AFP entry, we provide a formalisation of extended finite state machines 
                     (EFSMs) where models are represented as finite sets of transitions between 
                     states. EFSMs execute traces to produce observable outputs. We also define 
                     various simulation and equality metrics for EFSMs in terms of traces and prove 
                     their strengths in relation to each other. Another key contribution is a framework
                     of function definitions such that LTL properties can be phrased over EFSMs. 
                     Finally, we provide a simple example case study in the form of a drinks machine.},

	abstract  = {Model inference from system traces, e.g. for analysing legacy 
                     components or generating security tests for distributed components, 
                     is a common problem. Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) models, managing 
                     an internal state as a set of registers, are particular well suited for 
                     capturing the behaviour of stateful components however, existing inference 
                     techniques for (E)FSMs lack the ability to infer the internal state and its 
                     updates functions.
  
                     In this paper, we present a novel approach for inferring 
                     EFSMs from system traces that also infers the updates of the internal state. 
                     Our approach supports the merging of transitions that update the internal data 
                     state. Finally, our model is formalised in Isabelle/HOL, allowing for the 
                     machine-checked verification of system properties.},
